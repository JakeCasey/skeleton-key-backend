#When you want to add new data you add it here, then run npm run deploy. This deploys data model to prisma, which we then pull
#down in post deploy hook. This changes prisma.graphql, which builds queries and mutations for us. Then we move to schema.graphql,
#change mutations and queries, and we build resolvers in respective (Mutation.js and Query.js) files for advanced logic.
